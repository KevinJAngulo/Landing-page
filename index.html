    You can use this file as a starting point for any HTML page that you want to
    create.
    
    This is a comment. Comments will not be displayed in the browser. A comment 
    can go over one or multiple lines.

    Use the !DOCTYPE declaration to explicitly tell the browser receiving this 
    file that it is an HMTL file. A DOCTYPE associates a particular document
    with a document type definition (DTD), for example, the formal definition of
    a particular version of HTML 2.0 - 4.0. The HTML layout engines in modern 
    web browsers perform DOCTYPE "sniffing" or "switching", wherein the DOCTYPE 
    in a document determines a layout mode, such as "quirks mode" (for 
    compatibility) or "standards mode" (for compliance with current standards). 
    The DOCTYPE is retained in HTML5 as a "mostly useless, but required" header 
    only to trigger "standards mode" in common browsers.
-->
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<!--
    After the DOCTYPE, the html document begins as is indicated by the html 
    root element. You can think of your entire html document as a tree and 
    the html element as the root from which everything else sprouts.
    
    The language attribute is used by web search engines to display search 
    results in a particular language. E.g. if you are using Google in the US, 
    you will not see many French pages returned in your results.

<html lang="en">
<!-- 
    The head section has all the meta information, i.e., information about our 
    website that will not be displayed to the user. It tells browsers and search 
    engines basic information about the page such as the title, the charset, etc.
-->
<head>
    <!--
        No end tag is required for meta and link elements. That is the case 
        because they are non-XHTML tags. Help the browser understand what 
        characters to render by specifying a character set.
    -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">

        Users may view your site on a desktop or mobile browser. There is even 
        the trend of mobile first. The viewport takes care of this for us.

        The title is important for search engine optimization (SEO). It will be 
        visible to the user in the tab in which the site is opened. Titles 
        should be unique.

    The body holds all content that is visible to the user and it determines 
    the structure of your page.

    <!-- 
        Everything between two tags, including the tags, is an element. Headings
        come in six different sizes: <h1></h1> to <h6></h6>. Note that 
        it is not possible to autonumber headings in HTML. You would need to 
        write such functionality yourself.

        Additional items, such as style below, are attributes of an elment. The
        style code is our first example of CSS and how we can use it together 
        with HTML. We can also use style outside of the p tags, in which case it 
        would apply to the whole site.

    &emsp; During the following weeks, I will be working on this website to bring the user the best experience they can have. <br> <br>
    &emsp; By the end of the school semester, users will be able to rate their favorite soongs (in a 5-star rating system) and share their thoughts with everyone else online! We will be creating a safe space for users to review and share their thoughts
    with one another while discussing about something that unites us all; Music.

        &emsp;We will run our website with ads if you decide to use the free version. You'll be able to rate a limited amount of songs 
        until having to wait certain amount of time to resume your rating. If you decide to instead obtain the premium membership, 
        the website will run completely add-free and your experience will be limitless in our environment. You'll be the first 
        to be given updates and rewards as well as the ability to tests and review upcoming features!
